This folder contains npm images of Wijmo library core and interop modules
in various module formats.

The wijmo-<module_format>-min subfolders contain minified JavaScript modules 
in <module_format>, their typings, and metadata for Angular AoT compiler
(.metadata.json).

If you are an owner of a licensed version of Wijmo, the folder also includes 
wijmo-<module_format>-src subfolders, which contain TypeScript sources, 
non-minified JavaScript modules, and mapping files.

Please refer to the readme.txt files included in each subfolder for more 
details.
